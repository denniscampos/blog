This is my first post on my new fake blog! How exciting! ðŸ’¯

The purpose of starting a blog is to start sharing my feelings in my coding journey (full stack developer) and hoping it will help someone in the future. I am using the Gatsby framework to create this blog. 

I have been coding *seriously* since September. It is no surprise I decided to pick up a new skill during the pandemic. I am hoping to write fundamental tutorials that will help any upcoming programmers eventually. There are MANY fantastic articles on tutorials but from my experience is that with most tutorials, I hit a *wall* because the information is constantly updating. I want to update my future tutorials as things evolve. Is it going to be easy? Of course not, but I look forward to the challenge.

So far, I am enjoying the journey. I cannot lie about how frustrating it was initially because the vast information on the internet is *INSANE!!* I found an awesome website that explains the roadmap to the [backend world](https://roadmap.sh/backend)

I decided to also to streaming on Twitch. Shameless plug [twitch.tv/dnbull](https://twitch.tv/dnbull). I stream coding occasionally and play games! 

Please feel free to reach out to me on Twitter if you want to have a â˜• chat. ðŸ˜€
